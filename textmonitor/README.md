# Text monitor

By using this library it is possble to create UI for monitoring application and system status.

Idea is that actual gadget have its own display. Can be simple 128x64 oled display etc..



Viewing system is group of pages. 

Pages can be like
- General status (networking etc...)
- kernel message 
- stdout of actual program

The first line is dedicated to system status



- kexec, change kenrnels on fly?

- cleanup  errors %s -> %w , "new way"
